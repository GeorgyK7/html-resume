      With a comprehensive background as a results-oriented digital-focused
      sales manager, my professional experiences are marked by notable
      achievements and contributions in various sectors. In previous roles, I
      successfully spearheaded the establishment and management of a team of six
      bankers, achieving a commendable milestone of USD 15 million in loans sold
      within the B2C segment within one year. Subsequently, I replicated this
      success in the B2B sector, leading a team that facilitated the sale of
      loans amounting to USD 100 million.

      Transitioning to investment banking, I further distinguished myself by
      building and managing a portfolio of 100 satisfied clients, consistently
      delivering an average annual profit of 17 percent for each client.
      Additionally, my proficiency in public speaking and presentation skills is
      evidenced by the preparation and delivery of numerous successful bank
      presentations. In the retail sector, I demonstrated effective leadership
      by managing three distinct stores, each experiencing revenue growth of up
      to 120% within a year under my stewardship. My entrepreneurial acumen was
      further demonstrated in the successful operation of a billiard casino bar,
      where revenues increased by 30% monthly within a year, without incident.

      Drawing on a successful sports career, I possess a competitive and
      cooperative mindset, with achievements including winning championships in
      table tennis during my youth and coaching individuals to become champions
      of Moscow and Russia in the same sport.

      My skills are tailored to excel in diverse business domains, including
      sales, management, marketing, banking, team leadership, public speaking,
      coaching, investment, and retail management. My commitment to delivering
      exceptional service and fostering lasting customer relationships is
      evident in my consistent track record of success. I am a proactive,
      communicative, and competitive professional who collaborates effectively
      with colleagues, responds promptly to inquiries, and efficiently completes
      tasks. My ability to thrive under pressure is rooted in a decade-long
      career as a professional sportsman, where I honed the skill of performing
      at my best in challenging situations.

      Continuous improvement is a central tenet of my professional ethos,
      demonstrated by my pursuit of relevant courses in sales planning and
      management, leadership, mentoring, and proficiency in LEAN MI TOOLS.
      Fluent in English, Hebrew, and Russian, I am well-equipped to navigate
      diverse cultural and business environments.
